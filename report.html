                    <p>
                        This website was created as tasked by CSY1063 Web Development module. The aim of this
                        assignment was to design and develop a personal portfolio using HTML/CSS and
                        also managing the project by pushing it in Git and GitHub. The portfolio website made consists
                        of five pages, a home
                        page, projects page, contact page, video demonstration page, and this site report pager.

                    <h2>What i learned while development</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had no prior experience with web development.During the
                        development of this website, I learned how HTML(hypertext markup language) is used to develop
                        web pages and how CSS is used to
                        controls layout and styling for the website. I learned how to use HTML tags such as nav,
                        section,
                        header, and footer elements.I also learned how to use animations,grid layout and make the
                        website mobile phones responsive with the help of youtube and different sites .This
                        helped make my code clearer and
                        easier to understand.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Problems that i faced while development</h2>

                    <p>
                        One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating layouts using CSS Grid, Elements
                        were not aligning correctly like i had planned and some items in grid were overlapping.Also the
                        images
                        were stretching or not fitting properly inside grid containers. These problems were solved by
                        adjusting grid-template-columns, using fractional units (1/3), and applying object-fit to
                        images.

                        I also had problems with making the website phone responsive,it was challenging to make the
                        mobile webpage
                        with all the menu items (like home,projeect,demo,report) in a single page and the images would
                        be streched.To fix that the grid
                        css layout was changed on mobile devices to 1fr for the images and all the menu items werer
                        hidden and a new "=" (hamburger icon) was added that led to menu.html which had all the menu
                        items
                    </p>

                    <h2>Website Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        A simple and minimal style design was used to develop this website.I used minimal colors like
                        (White,gray and black) for
                        this website to make it professional. Same navigation
                        menu was used across all pages that made website professional and functionable.Animations were
                        also minimal to make website more engaging.And different
                        grid css layout was also used in project page like mentioned in the module.

                    <h2>GitHub and ai usage</h2>
                    <p>
                        GitHub was used throughout the development process like mentioned in the module.I committed my
                        work
                        with commit messages (like feat:grid layout was added) to show the progress of the website over
                        time.This
                        helped me fix my mistakes while developing my project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ChatGPT,youtube and different site was used during this assignment to help with understanding
                        layout
                        issues,learning animations.It helped me understand HTML and CSS concepts,animations, and
                        responsive design, and helped me fix errors during development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, all code was manually written and tested by me.I modified the code to fit my design,and
                        understood how each part
                        worked. This process helped me learn faster in web development.
